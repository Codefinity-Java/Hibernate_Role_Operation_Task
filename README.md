# Hibernate_Role_Operation_Task

Your task is to implement the methods in the classes `RoleDaoImpl`, `RoleServiceImpl`, `EmployeeDaoImpl`, and `EmployeeServiceImpl`. This is not difficult; you have done this many times. The only potential challenge might be with the `updateRole` method, but I'm confident you can handle it.

To test your solution, you need to run the code I have written for you in the main class. Then, you will need to compare the result with the correct result, which I will provide below.

Testing such large applications with database interaction implementation becomes increasingly challenging, so now your project will be tested by yourself (or you can peek at the Solution).
